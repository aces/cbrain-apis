## CBRAIN APIs

This repository contains libraries for accessing the CBRAIN
platform.

Two languages are currently supported:

* Ruby; the API can be found in the file ``ruby/cbrain_ruby_api.rb``
* Perl; the API can be found in the file ``perl/CbrainPerlAPI.pm``

The full documention about these APIs can be generated locally
by running a bash script provided at the top of the repository,
``install_doc.sh``.

## Credits

This project's code was originally a part of the CBRAIN platform
(released separately), but the API itself was funded by CANARIE
during the summer of 2014.
